### Prerequisites
------------

As a pre-requisite to running this locally, you will need a working installation of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with all of the necessary dependencies installed. 

### Running the Code
------------

To run this code, do something like:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/OxfordDemSci/ex2020.git
```

and then execute each of the scripts (0 through 10) which will undertake sequential tasks like defining skeletons, to undertaking the PCLM, cleaning outputs for analysis, and data visualisation


### Structure
----------------

* _cfg_ relates to: configuration files
* _dat_ relates to: input source data
* _out_ relates to: output data, figures, and sensitivity analysis
* _src_ relates to: code to replicate the wrangling, analysis and visualisation
* _tmp_ relates to: a subdir to store temporary files
* _ass_ relates to: a place to store repo assets

### Versioning
------------

This version of the code is pre-publication (v.0.1.0). If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to raise an issue here on this repository, or to e-mail one of the corresponding authors of the paper!
